## Demo

You can find a sample report generated using the tool [here](samples/SOC_Report_January_2025.pdf). and a sameple json file [here](samples/SOC_Report_January_2025.json).

## ⚠️ Important Note on Templates

The HTML report template (`threat-report.html`) is designed to be fully customizable and should be tailored to your organization's specific requirements. The provided template is a basic starting point and **should be modified** to match your organization's:

- Branding guidelines
- Visual design preferences
- Specific reporting requirements
- Content structure needs

We strongly recommend customizing the template before using it in production. The default template is intentionally minimal to serve as a foundation for your own design.
